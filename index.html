                    <h4>What is Git?</h4>
                    <p>Git is a version control system; you can think of it as a series of snapshots (commits)
                    of your code base.  With the creation of each snapshot you build out a whole application, seeing
                    the growth of a full app. During this time you can make branches to experiment and come back to a 
                    previous snapshots you took or merge those experiments into your app.</p>
                    <h4>What is Github?</h4>
                    <p>GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration.  It lets you and others work
                        together on projects from anywhere using those code snapshots that you took during development.</p>
